Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a sucessful one.  Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly ",
