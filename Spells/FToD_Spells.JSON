If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell\u2019s target even if you can\u2019t see it. If the named target isn\u2019t within range, the lance dissipates without effect.{NL}The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t incapacitated.{NL}At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.",
